{"name":"ua-security","tagline":"Simple token-based security for AngularJS","body":"### ua-security\r\nUA Security is a simple token-based security module for Angular JS applications. It contains a few configurable services to perform authentication against a RESTful endpoint, store the user credentials for future xhr requests, and perform common authorization functions.  Those authorization functions include:\r\n* isAuthenticated: authenticated user exists\r\n* isAnonymous: no authenticated user exists\r\n* hasAllRoles: the authenticated user has all roles supplied\r\n* hasAnyRole: the authenticated user has any of the roles supplied\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n* David Spies (@dspies)\r\n\r\n### Problems\r\nThis project has a very specific scope at the moment, but feel free to contact me with any questions or suggestions.  I will update the [ua-security wiki](https://github.com/dspies/ua-security/wiki) in future with a roadmap.  If you have problems, please file an [issue](https://github.com/dspies/ua-security/issues) or better yet, file a pull request.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
